            <p class="sectionsubtag ">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and

                to explore the interactions between biological processes and education.[143][144][145][146] Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading,[145] numerical cognition,[147] attention, and their attendant
                and ADHD as they relate to education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.</p>
